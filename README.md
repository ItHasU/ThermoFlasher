# ThermoFlasher

This project is very inspired from [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer).

The goal is to provide a simple Windows utility to flash ESP32 boards with the [Wireless Thermometer](https://github.com/ItHasU/WirelessThermometer) firmware.
We use [Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to package esptool in an executable.

2. Connect the Lolin 32 board to your computer
3. Execute ThermoFlasher.exe
4. Follow setup instructions from the [original firmware repository](https://github.com/ItHasU/WirelessThermometer).
